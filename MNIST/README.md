# MNIST Neural Network Learning Project

Welcome to your hands-on journey into Machine Learning and Deep Learning! This project will teach you how neural networks work by implementing digit recognition from the MNIST dataset.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd MNIST
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Follow the Learning Path

Run the scripts in order:

```bash
# Phase 1: Explore the data
python 01_explore_mnist.py

# Phase 2: Build your first network
python 02_simple_nn.py

# Phase 3: Train the network (the magic happens here!)
python 03_train_model.py

# Phase 5: Advanced CNN model (>99% accuracy)
python 04_improved_model.py
```

### 3. Read the Learning Plan
